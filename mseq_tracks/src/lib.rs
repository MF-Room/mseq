//! # `track` â€“ MSeq Track Construction and Loading
//!
//! This crate provides utilities to define, generate, and load different kinds of
//! sequencer tracks into the MSeq engine. It serves as a bridge between high-level
//! musical concepts (e.g., acid patterns, arpeggios, dividers, MIDI files) and
//! the internal [`DeteTrack`] representation used by the sequencer.
//!
