//! Core framework for building custom MIDI sequencers.
//!
//! `mseq_core` provides the foundational traits and utilities needed to implement
//! your own MIDI sequencer, with a focus on portability and modularity.
//!
//! This crate is built with `#![no_std]`, making it suitable for embedded platforms
//! as well as standard operating systems.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! To create a custom sequencer, you typically:
//!
//! - Implement the [`Conductor`] trait to define your sequencer's control logic.
//! - Define one or more tracks by either:
//!   - Implementing the [`Track`] trait for custom behavior.
//!   - Instantiating [`DeteTrack`] for deterministic, looping patterns.
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! - For OS-based systems, use the [`mseq`](https://crates.io/crates/mseq) crate â€” a reference implementation of `mseq_core` for standard platforms.
//! - For embedded development (e.g., STM32F4), see the [`mseq_embedded`](https://github.com/MF-Room/mseq_embedded) repository, which provides an STM32-specific integration of `mseq_core`.
//!
//! ## Crate Features
//!
//! - No `std` dependency (`#![no_std]` compatible).
//! - Modular and extensible design.
//! - Reusable across multiple platforms.
